Neural Network Model:
Preprocessing: We first removed data points that are computed within 10 days of the cardiac shock. Using the remaining data, we consider each feature from each day as an individual feature. Next, we split the data into a training and a testing set, where the testing set consists of 20% of the total data. We then replaced missing values in the training set with the mode values in each feature. We also replaced missing values in the testing set using the mode values we computed from the training set.
Model Training: We build a neural network model with three layers; the first layer has 128 hidden units, the second has 64 units, and the last layer has 2 units. The ReLU activation follows the first and second layer, and the softmax activation follows the last layer. In total, there are about 84,000 parameters. We use the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 to train the model for 20 epochs. During training, we reweighed the training instances based on their label frequency.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the neural network on the test data, we achieved an accuracy of 93% and an ROC-AUC of 91.3%.
